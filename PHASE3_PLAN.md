# Phase 3: Smart Recommendations & Advanced Automation
## LADWP Grid Intelligence Dashboard

---

## üéØ Overview

**Status**: Ready to start (Phase 1 & 2 complete)

Phase 3 transforms the dashboard from a **monitoring + prediction system** into an **intelligent decision support system** that tells operators exactly what to do and automates responses where appropriate.

**The Evolution**:
- **Phase 1**: "Here's what's happening" (Real-time monitoring)
- **Phase 2**: "Here's what will happen" (ML predictions)
- **Phase 3**: "Here's what you should do" (Smart recommendations) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **WE ARE HERE**

---

## üß† What Phase 3 Adds

### 1. **Smart Recommendation Engine**
Turn ML predictions into specific, actionable advice with cost/benefit analysis.

**Example**:
```
Current System (Phase 2):
  ‚ö†Ô∏è "High anomaly detected - 3,200 MW demand spike predicted at 2 PM"
  
Phase 3 Enhancement:
  üí° "Recommendation: Activate Demand Response Program A"
     ‚Ä¢ Reduce 250 MW load for 2 hours
     ‚Ä¢ Avoid peak pricing: Save $45,000
     ‚Ä¢ ROI: $45k savings vs $5k program cost = 9x return
     ‚Ä¢ Confidence: 87%
     ‚Ä¢ Action: [Activate Now] [Schedule] [Dismiss]
```

### 2. **Automated Alert System**
Multi-channel notifications with escalation policies.

**Capabilities**:
- **Email**: Send to operators on duty
- **SMS**: Critical alerts to mobile devices
- **Slack/Teams**: Team notifications
- **PagerDuty**: On-call engineer escalation
- **Webhook**: Integration with SCADA/EMS

**Smart Features**:
- Priority-based routing (Critical ‚Üí Manager, High ‚Üí Operator, Medium ‚Üí Dashboard only)
- Escalation (No response in 15 min ‚Üí Escalate to supervisor)
- Quiet hours (Non-critical alerts suppressed 10 PM - 6 AM)
- Alert grouping (Multiple similar events ‚Üí Single notification)

### 3. **Price Spike Prediction Model**
Predict price spikes 1-6 hours in advance using XGBoost classifier.

**How It Works**:
1. **Features**: Hour, day, season, recent demand, weather, congestion patterns
2. **Training**: Historical data where prices >$100/MWh (spike threshold)
3. **Output**: Probability score + time window + expected magnitude

**Example Output**:
```
üî¥ PRICE SPIKE ALERT
  ‚Ä¢ Probability: 78% chance of spike
  ‚Ä¢ Time window: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM (2 hours)
  ‚Ä¢ Expected price: $150-$180/MWh (vs $45 current)
  ‚Ä¢ Impact: $135k/hour at full load
  ‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Reduce non-critical load by 30%
```

### 4. **Cost Calculator & ROI Analysis**
Quantify the financial impact of every recommendation.

**Calculations**:
- **Cost avoidance**: (Peak price - off-peak price) √ó MW √ó hours
- **Program costs**: Demand response payments, operator time, lost productivity
- **Net savings**: Cost avoidance - program costs
- **Payback period**: When does action break even?

**Dashboard Display**:
```
Recommendation: Shift 500 MW pumping to off-peak
  ‚úÖ Energy cost: $12,500 savings (500 MW √ó 5 hrs √ó $5/MWh difference)
  ‚ùå Program cost: $2,000 (customer incentives)
  üí∞ Net savings: $10,500
  üìä ROI: 5.25x return
  ‚è±Ô∏è Payback: Immediate (same day)
```

### 5. **SCADA/EMS Integration**
Connect dashboard to existing operational systems for seamless automation.

**Integration Points**:
- **Read from SCADA**: Current load, equipment status, reservoir levels
- **Write to SCADA**: Automated triggers for pre-approved actions
- **EMS coordination**: Share recommendations with Energy Management System
- **Data logging**: All actions logged to historian for compliance

**Safety Features**:
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Critical actions require operator approval
- **Automated actions**: Only for pre-approved low-risk operations
- **Override capability**: Operator can always override recommendations
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of all automated actions

**Architecture**:
```
Dashboard ‚Üê‚Üí Integration Layer ‚Üê‚Üí SCADA/EMS
            (REST API/OPC UA)
```

**Files to create**:
```python
# integrations/scada_connector.py
class SCADAConnector:
    def read_realtime_data(self):
        """Read current load, equipment status"""
        # Protocol: OPC UA, Modbus, or REST API
        pass
    
    def send_recommendation(self, action_id, approval_status):
        """Send approved action to SCADA"""
        pass
    
    def log_action(self, action_id, timestamp, result):

- **Rate limiting**: Max 5 automated actions per hour
- **Validation**: Check system state before executing
- **Rollback**: Ability to undo recent actions
- **Audit**: Complete logging of all actions

**Dashboard additions**:
- SCADA status indicator
- Manual override controls
- Action approval queue
- Integration health monitoring

**Estimated time**: 15-20 days

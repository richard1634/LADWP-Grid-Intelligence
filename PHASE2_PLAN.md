2. **Automated Anomaly Detection** - ML-driven alerts beyond simple statistical thresholds
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Learn normal vs. abnormal grid behavior
4. **Actionable Recommendations** - AI-powered operational suggestions
5. **Historical Analysis** - Trend analysis and performance benchmarking

---

## 📊 Phase 2 Features

### 1. **ML-Driven Anomaly Detection** ⭐ Priority #1

**Current State (Phase 1):**
- Simple statistical spike detection (2.5σ threshold)
- Rolling window comparison
- Manual threshold tuning

**Phase 2 Enhancement:**
- **Isolation Forest** - Detect multivariate anomalies (price + demand + time patterns)
- **LSTM Autoencoder** - Learn normal patterns, flag deviations
- **Seasonal Decomposition** - Separate trends from anomalies
- **Contextual Anomalies** - "Normal" spike at 6 PM vs "Abnormal" spike at 2 AM

**Implementation:**
```python
# Models to implement:
- IsolationForest (scikit-learn) - Quick, unsupervised
- LSTM Autoencoder (TensorFlow/PyTorch) - Deep learning, pattern learning
- Prophet (Facebook) - Time series with seasonality
```

**Data Requirements:**
- Historical price data (6+ months for training)
- Historical demand data (6+ months)
- Feature engineering: hour_of_day, day_of_week, month, is_weekend, etc.

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Anomaly confidence score (0-100%)
- "Normal" vs "Unusual" indicator
- Historical anomaly timeline
- False positive rate tracking

---

### 2. **Demand Forecasting** (Next 24-48 hours)

**What to Predict:**
- LADWP demand for next 24-48 hours
- Confidence intervals (±5% accuracy target)
- Peak demand timing and magnitude

**Models:**
- **Option A: SARIMA** - Traditional, interpretable, works with limited data
- **Option B: XGBoost** - Gradient boosting, handles complex patterns
- **Option C: Temporal Fusion Transformer** - State-of-the-art, requires more data

**Features:**
```python
Features for demand prediction:
- Historical demand (lags: 1h, 2h, 24h, 168h)
- Hour of day (0-23)
- Day of week (Mon-Sun)
- Month/Season
- Temperature forecast (if available)
- Is weekend/holiday
- Time since last peak
```

**Dashboard Display:**
- Overlay ML prediction vs CAISO forecast
- Confidence bands (shaded area)
- Accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE)
- "Model says: Peak at 5:30 PM (±30 min), 2,850 MW (±150 MW)"

---

### 3. **Price Spike Prediction** (Next 1-6 hours)

**What to Predict:**
- Probability of price spike in next N hours
- Likely magnitude if spike occurs
- Root cause classification (supply shortage, transmission constraint, etc.)

**Approach:**
- **Classification Model**: XGBoost or Random Forest
- **Target**: Binary (spike yes/no) + Regression (magnitude)
- **Threshold**: Price > $100/MWh or >2.5σ above rolling average

**Features:**
```python
- Current price trend (last 1-6 hours)
- Current demand level
- Rate of demand change
- Time of day / day of week
- Season
- Recent price volatility
- Historical spike patterns at this hour
- External: Weather alerts, grid events (if available)
```

**Dashboard Display:**
- "⚠️ 72% probability of price spike in next 3 hours"
- Recommended actions based on probability
- Historical accuracy tracker

---

### 4. **Pattern Recognition & Baseline Learning**

**Learn "Normal" Behavior:**
- Typical demand curve by day of week
- Typical price ranges by hour
- Seasonal patterns (summer peaks, winter patterns)
- Weekend vs weekday differences

**Detect Deviations:**
- "Today's demand is 15% higher than typical Monday"
- "Prices unusually high for this time of day"
- "Demand ramping faster than normal"

**Implementation:**
```python
# Store baseline patterns:
- 7 demand profiles (Mon-Sun typical curves)
- Hourly price percentiles (p5, p25, p50, p75, p95)
- Seasonal adjustment factors
- Holiday patterns
```

**Dashboard Display:**
- Current vs Expected comparison chart
- "% deviation from normal" indicator
- Pattern similarity score

---

### 5. **Operational Intelligence & Recommendations**

**AI-Powered Recommendations:**

Based on predictions, provide actionable advice:

| Condition | Recommendation | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Price spike predicted (>80% prob) | Defer non-critical loads by 3 hours | High |
| Low price period detected | Increase pumping operations, charge storage | Medium |
| Demand approaching peak | Activate demand response programs | High |
| Unusual demand pattern | Review operational changes, check sensors | Medium |
| Grid stress detected | Pre-stage backup systems, alert operators | Critical |

**Implementation:**
- Rule-based system + ML confidence scores
- Cost-benefit analysis (e.g., "Deferring load saves est. $12,500")
- Automated report generation

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
CAISO API → Data Collection → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Predictions → Dashboard
    ↓
 Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
    ↓
 Historical Storage (CSV/Parquet)
```

### Models to Build

1. **Anomaly Detector** (IsolationForest)
   - Input: price, demand, hour, day_of_week
   - Output: anomaly_score (0-1), is_anomaly (bool)
   - Retrain: Weekly

2. **Demand Forecaster** (XGBoost)
   - Input: historical demand + time features
   - Output: demand prediction (MW), confidence interval
   - Retrain: Daily

3. **Price Spike Predictor** (Random Forest)
   - Input: price history, demand, time features
   - Output: spike_probability (0-1), expected_magnitude
   - Retrain: Daily

### Storage Requirements
```
Historical Data Storage:
- Raw API responses: ~50 KB/hour × 24 hours × 365 days = ~440 MB/year
- Processed features: ~20 KB/hour × 8760 hours = ~175 MB/year
- Model checkpoints: ~5 MB per model × 3 models = ~15 MB
Total: ~630 MB/year (very manageable)
```

## 🤔 Decision Points

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **How much historical data can we collect?**
   - CAISO provides up to 90 days historical via API
   - More data = better models
   - Recommend: Start collecting now, train models after 30 days

2. **What's the priority: Anomaly detection or forecasting?**
   - Anomaly detection = Immediate operational value
   - Forecasting = Strategic planning value
   - Recommend: Start with anomaly detection

3. **Simple vs Complex models?**
   - Simple (Isolation Forest, XGBoost) = Fast, interpretable, works with less data
   - Complex (LSTM, Transformers) = Higher accuracy, requires more data/compute
   - Recommend: Start simple, upgrade later if needed

4. **Storage: Database vs Files?**
   - SQLite = Simple, embedded, good for single-user
   - PostgreSQL = Scalable, multi-user, production-ready

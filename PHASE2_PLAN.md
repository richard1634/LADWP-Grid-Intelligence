# Phase 2: Machine Learning Features ✅ COMPLETED
## LADWP Grid Intelligence Dashboard

---

## 🎯 Goals - ACHIEVED

Add predictive capabilities and smarter anomaly detection using machine learning.

**What we built:**
1. ✅ Historical data collection (all 12 months, ~10,000+ records)
2. ✅ Pattern learning (month-specific baseline patterns)
3. ✅ ML-powered anomaly detection (12 Isolation Forest models)
4. ✅ Future anomaly prediction (48-hour forecasting)
5. 🔄 Automated recommendations (Phase 3)

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Collect Historical Data** (2-3 hours)

Collect 30-90 days of historical price and demand data from CAISO.

**Create:**
- `data/data_collector.py` - Script to fetch and store historical data
- `data/historical_data/` - Parquet files with collected data

**Run once to bootstrap, then daily to keep current.**

---

### **Step 2: Learn Normal Patterns** (4-6 hours)

Calculate what "normal" looks like for each day of the week and hour.

**Create:**
- `models/baseline_patterns.py` - Calculate typical demand/price patterns
- `models/baseline_data/` - Store learned patterns as JSON

**Add to dashboard:**
- "Current vs Expected" comparison
- "% deviation from normal" indicator

---

### **Step 3: ML Anomaly Detection** (1-2 days)

Replace simple statistical detection with Isolation Forest ML model.

**Create:**
- `models/anomaly_detector.py` - Isolation Forest implementation
- `training/train_anomaly_model.py` - Training pipeline

**Add to dashboard:**
- Anomaly confidence scores (0-100%)
- Better detection with fewer false alarms

---

### **Step 4: Predict Price Spikes** (2-3 days)

Predict probability of price spikes 1-6 hours ahead.

**Create:**
- `models/price_predictor.py` - XGBoost classifier
- `data/feature_engineering.py` - Feature creation

**Add to dashboard:**
- "72% chance of spike in next 3 hours"
- Recommended actions

---

### **Step 5: Smart Recommendations** (2-3 days)

Turn predictions into actionable advice with cost estimates.

**Create:**
- `models/recommendation_engine.py` - Action recommendations
- `models/cost_calculator.py` - Savings estimates

**Add to dashboard:**
- Prioritized action list
- Cost/benefit for each recommendation

## 📦 Dependencies

Install as needed for each step:

```bash
# Step 1
pip install pyarrow

# Step 3
pip install scikit-learn scipy

# Step 4
pip install xgboost statsmodels

# Optional
pip install seaborn prophet
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Day 1:** Collect historical data
- **Day 2:** Learn baseline patterns, update dashboard
- **Week 1:** Train and deploy ML anomaly detection
- **Week 2-3:** Build price spike predictor
- **Week 3-4:** Add recommendation engine

**Total: 3-4 weeks to full Phase 2 completion**

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Anomaly Detection:**
- >85% precision, >90% recall
- <5% false positive rate

**Price Prediction:**
- >75% accuracy for 3-hour forecasts
- 2+ hours early warning for spikes

**Operational Value:**
- 50% reduction in false alarms
- $10k+ monthly savings through optimized operations
